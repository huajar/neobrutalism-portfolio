<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This portfolio is built with functionality and style in mind, embracing the Neobrutalist aesthetic while ensuring a seamless user experience. It serves as a personal showcase for projects, skills, and achievements, making it easy to navigate while maintaining a unique visual identity.

Why Neobrutalism?
* **Minimal yet bold**: A raw and direct approach to web design.
* **High contrast & clarity**: Focus on readability and structure.
* **Modern yet timeless**: A blend of digital brutalism and contemporary UX principles.

This portfolio is not just a websiteâ€”it's a statement. Built for those who dare to stand out. ðŸš€
