<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This portfolio is built in Neobrutalism style and aesthetics. It serves as a personal showcase of projects, skills and achievements.

Why Neobrutalism?
* **Unrefined and striking**: A design approach that prioritizes simplicity and directness.
* **Strong contrast**: A well-defined structure that enhances clarity and readability.
* **Modern yet timeless**: A blend of Brutalist style with user-centric design principles.
